# Hide messages from blocked users (CSS) on Discord
Hide the `x blocked messages` box on Discord. Thanks cf &lt;3.

# Sidenote
I have tested this with BeautifulDiscord and it does **not** work. However, it does work with [DI](https://github.com/DiscordInjections/DiscordInjections) (DiscordInjections), so if you'd like to use it, I'd recommend setting up DI so you're able to utilise it with no error.
